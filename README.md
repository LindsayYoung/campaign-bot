A twitter bot that consumes the [Federal Election Commission's API](https://api.open.fec.gov/developers/). 

Right now it uses the real-time [efiling API feed](https://api.open.fec.gov/developers/#!/efiling/get_efile_filings) and tweets out the latest filings.

I also get an email of new filings in the morning. 

This isn't official, it's just for fun.
